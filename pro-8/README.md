PROJECT SUMMARY :- 

💻 Project: Countdown & Quotes Application --

📌 Project Definition ::-

This interactive application is built entirely with JavaScript and focuses on creating a dynamic, engaging user experience by blending time-based events with motivational content. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of core JS concepts like DOM manipulation, arrays, functions, loops, and advanced time control methods (setTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval).

🧩 Project Flow & Features ::

⏳ Countdown Timer :-

Objective: Display a real-time countdown to a specific future event (e.g., Exam, New Year).

Mechanism: Uses setInterval() to update the time every second.

Completion: The timer automatically stops using clearInterval() when it hits zero, displaying the message: “Time’s up! The event has started 🎉”.

Control: Includes a Start/Pause button to toggle the timer (switching between setInterval() and clearInterval()).

💬 Quotes Slider :-

Storage: Stores 5–6 motivational quotes in a JavaScript array.

Automatic Slide: Quotes automatically switch and display on the webpage every 3–5 seconds, controlled by a loop and setInterval().

User Control: Features dedicated Next/Previous buttons to allow manual navigation of the quotes alongside the automatic sliding.

🖼️ Modal Popup ;-

Trigger: A modal window appears precisely 5 seconds after the page loads.

Mechanism: Controlled asynchronously using the setTimeout() function.

Content: Contains a welcome message or important event information.

Interaction: Users can dismiss the modal using a dedicated close button.

✅ Core Technologies :-

JavaScript (ES6+): All dynamic logic, array manipulation, and asynchronous timing.

HTML & CSS: Structure and styling.
